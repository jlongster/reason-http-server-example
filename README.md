Uses [cohttp](https://github.com/mirage/ocaml-cohttp) to create a
simple server listening on port 8000. Install dependencies with `npm
install`, then build with `npm run build` which will invoke Rebel to
build the project.

Run the server at `./_build/default/src/app.native` and visit
http://localhost:8000/ in your browser.
